    "## Explanation of the DQN Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Environment Setup**: The `CartPole-v1` environment from OpenAI Gym is used to simulate the inverted pendulum problem. The goal is to balance a pole on a cart by applying forces to the cart.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DQN Agent**:\n",
    "   - The agent is defined with a neural network model that approximates the Q-function.\n",
    "   - The model has three layers: two hidden layers with 24 neurons each and ReLU activation, and an output layer with linear activation.\n",
    "   - The agent uses an epsilon-greedy policy for exploration and exploitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Experience Replay**:\n",
    "   - The agent stores past experiences in a replay buffer.\n",
    "   - During training, random batches are sampled from the buffer to update the Q-values, improving stability and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Training Loop**:\n",
    "   - For each episode, the agent interacts with the environment, selects actions, and stores experiences.\n",
    "   - The agent trains on batches of experiences from the replay buffer to update its Q-function.\n",
    "   - The exploration rate (`epsilon`) decays over time to shift from exploration to exploitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Performance Metrics**:\n",
    "   - The score for each episode is printed, along with the current exploration rate.\n",
    "   - The training continues for 1000 episodes or until the agent achieves satisfactory performance."
